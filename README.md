# Dynamical systems in systems biology in Julia

Biochemical reaction modeling and demonstrations of concepts in dynamical systems in Julia. 

**Notes:**
* Most of the code is based on material/exercises from the course "Mathematical Modelling for Bioengineering and Systems Biology"
in ETH Zurich.
* Currently (and in the short-term future) playing around in Julia, so most of the code is a _work in progress_.
